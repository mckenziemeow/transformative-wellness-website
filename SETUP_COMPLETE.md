## 🔍 Search Console Status

Since `transformativemedspa.com` is already a property in Search Console, you should:

1. **Log into** [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. **Select** your property
3. **Submit sitemap:** Enter `https://transformativemedspa.com/sitemap.xml`
4. **Request indexing** of key pages

**Note:** Since you're using GoDaddy DNS (not Cloudflare for the current site), you'll need to either:
- Keep both sites running temporarily, OR
- Update DNS when ready to switch

## 📱 Facebook Pixel Status

The code you provided (`pit-2294e821-a3c5-4986-a4c9-92db5d3b5454`) looks like a **GHL tracking ID**, not a Facebook Pixel ID.

### To Add Facebook Pixel:

2. Find your Pixel ID (15 digits only, like: `123456789012345`)
3. Send me that number and I'll add it immediately
